Hello, my name is Justin!

> It is the anglicized form of the Latin given name _Justinus_, a derivative of _Justus_, meaning "just", "fair", or "righteous".

In short, I strive to live up to the meaning of my name which led me to pursue a career in cybersecurity and this is my portfolio.

## Professional Statement

As a cybersecurity professional, I am deeply committed to upholding the highest ethical standards, continuously advancing my knowledge to stay ahead of emerging threats, and adapting to the ever-changing cybersecurity landscape. By prioritizing honesty, transparency, and respect for privacy, I strive to do what is required to protect sensitive information and build trust and resilience within organizations, effectively supporting their security goals as if they were my own.
